# Finals Notes

This is a collection of notes and templates I brought into finals. Note that the pipelining cheatsheets in particular had issues which are written below too.

1. ASCII Table (From [here](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:ASCII-Table.svg))
2. CS2100 Finals Summary (Archived from [@jovyntls](https://github.com/jovyntls/cheatsheets/blob/master/CS2100/cs2100-finals-summary.pdf))
3. K-Map template (Felt like I wanted to create my own with my own ordering so here it is)
4. MIPS reference sheet
5. Pipelining Table (This is not very usefull if you can use the other ones unless there's an edge case you didn't cover)
6. Pipelining Notes (This was taken from [@woojiahao](https://github.com/woojiahao/nus/blob/main/cs2100/pipelining_notes.pdf) **BUT IT ASSUMES FORWARDING INCLUDES EARLY BRANCHING**)

Proposed change: Add a sub column under forwarding for forwarding without early branching (EB/ID stage branching) with corresponding counts

7. Pipelining Enlightenment (Courtesy of Yao Xuan but has issues due to **SW STALL COUNT**)

Proposed change: Consider each case for `sw` before editing
