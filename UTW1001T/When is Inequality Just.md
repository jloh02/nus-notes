> Equality of Opportunity (Locke/Nozick)
> Equality of Luck (Singer)
> Equality of Social Opportunity (Anderson)
## Locke's Criterion
Something is rightfully yours if:
- Labour Condition: You worked for it and;
- Sufficiency Condition: You leave enough, or as good, for others

## Luck Egalitarianism
- Inequality is just only when it is due to what is in our control
- Protect against brute luck but not option luck
- Aims to minimize effect of luck

### Objections to Luck Egalitarianism
- Relational problem
	- Involve partiality; We treat our friends and family better
	- BUT relationships are due to luck
		- Circumstantial luck affects which family you are in
		- Constitutional luck (due to personality) affects who you become friends with
	- Minimising the effect of luck seems to undermine relationships
		- Avoiding partiality due to luck-based arrangements
		- Parents giving preferential treatment to their children is supporting circumstantial luck - Likewise with friends
- Anderson 1999, pg 307
	- Abandonment Problem (Option Luck)
		- Scenario: An uninsured driver gets into an accident and cannot pay for treatment. Luck egalitarianism supports that the medics have no obligation to give him emergency care
		- Anderson suggests there should be some basic respect for life
		- Luck egalitarians suggest option luck derives from choice - They chose to run the risk, hence, they should bear their own consequences
		- Anderson argues that the abandonment of such victims violates our obligation to treat everyone with sufficient respect and concern
	- Disrespect Problem (Brute Luck)
		- Luck egalitarianism compensates victims of bad brute luck for "their defective internal assets"
			- Requires pity & judgements of inferiority
			- Fails to respect those they help
			- Argues we should do it in equality to others

## Relational Egalitarianism
- Affirms equal moral worth of persons
- Value of equality lies in having relationships between equals
	- Wealth inequality is a problem only to the extent that it undermines relational equality
- Anderson creates a distinction
	- Luck egalitarianism suggests equality of social relations serves to achieve equality of fortune i.e. distributive justice
	- Relational equality proposes distributive justice to achieve equality of social relations
		- Tolerates some sense of luck
- Relational egalitarianism solves some of luck egalitarianism problems
	- Relational: Sees relationships between equals as the point of equality
	- Abandonment: Obliged to protect relationship as equals
	- Disrespect: Equal moral worth

### Libertarians vs Egalitarians
- Libertarians focus on negative conception of freedom
- Positive freedom could remain lacking
- Social conditions of freedom: Political, social and economic power
### Objections to Relational Egalitarianism
- Treating someone as equal
	- Are people being given extra social privileges?
		- E.g. rich buying superior treatment
	- Earned privileges are not innate and others can also obtain those privileges if they work for it
- Can there be relational equality with resource inequality?
	- Is this a borrowed idea from others?
- When is something rightfully yours?
	- Is luck-based allocation fine just because there is relational equality?
	- Is this based on luck or control?
### Are we all equal?
- Equal abilities/capabilities
	- But we have differences in abilities
- We are all humans
	- Arbitrary line in the same choice of similarity
	- Similar to identification on basis of race, sex, etc
- We are all sentient & have desires
	- Doesn't that make animals equal to humans?
	- Counter
		- Similarity and compatibility of consciousness
		- E.g. dogs experience pain similar to ours
- Equally loved by God?
	- Not convincing
	- Why does God love us equally? Our qualities? Is it some arbitrary line again?
