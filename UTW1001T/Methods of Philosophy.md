## Luck
How does policy get rid of the effect of luck?
- Egalitarianism
- Inequality is just iff it wholly due to what is within our control
	- E.g. Effort, choice
	- Circumstantial & constitutional luck beyond our control
- Protect against brute luck, but not option luck
	- Brute luck: Not due to choice
	- Option luck: Due to choice
- The unequal effect of luck should be minimized
	- Inability to accurate measure luck

## Equality of Opportunity
