- Should anyone be this rich, if there are people this poor?
- Do we deserve our place in the income hierarchy?


Why are the low-income households in their situation?
Perception: Because they make bad decisions?

## Singapore's Income Inequality Issues
- 22% (low) maximum personal income tax
- Low social expenditure: 7.28% of GDP in 2018; OECD average at 20%
- Low government expenditure: 15.8% of GDP in 2018

Should Singapore become a welfare state?

### Arguments against becoming a welfare state
- Priority is giving equal opportunity, not distributing money from the rich to the poor
- Is not an entitlement/right (Moralistic claim)
- Risks detrimental effects on welfare recipients (Empirical claim)

> **Property Rights:** You are **morally** justified to use it and exclude others from using it


## Bread World
- 20 bread, 1 bread required to survive
- 10 people
- 1 person takes all 20 bread
- Is this moral?

### Arguments
#### Wrong
- Is all effort deserving of rewards?
	- Effort deserves reward only for things you have the moral right to earn
	- Does the person in bread world have the right to earn what others need to survive?
	- Does that mean sustenance trumps extravagance?
#### Not Wrong
- "The 9 chose to be deprived"
	- Conflict 1: Implies contradiction - the 9 would give no effort if they knew
	- Conflict 2: Why should opportunity for extravagance trump subsistence?
- By merit
- The rich is not obligated to give the poor for free
	- Can trade bread for labour
	- Conflict: Fair trade is difficult due to poverty
