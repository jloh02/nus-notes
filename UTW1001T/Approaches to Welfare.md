2 Approaches
- Property --> Need --> Welfare Provision
	- The rich have worked hard to earn
	- Now they can help those in need
- Need --> Welfare Provision --> Property
	- Ensure subsistence
	- Then distribute for extravagance

- Should ethics determine property law? Or property law determine ethics?
- Should we require additional effort for subsistence?
- Opinion: The crux is not about extravagance vs subsistence. It is about liberty vs disrespect
- Does welfare corrupt recipients?
	- Are humans innately selfish & exploitative?
	- Are humans innately decent and cooperative?
- Brain development can be affected by poverty and can lead to behavioural problems
- Poverty and crime rates are linked
- Being in poverty is likened to being sleep deprived
- Poverty can make people passive and resigned --> Vicious cycle



- Our country is governed by laws
- Laws can be just or unjust
- Are existing property laws just? Does subsistence override extravagance?


## Right vs Privilege: Why does it matter?
- Welfare rights give access to sufficiency, security & access
