## Outline
- Intro
	- Definition of meritocracy
		- Individual Agency and Success: Meritocracy posits that individual success is determined primarily by personal effort, inherent abilities, and talent rather than external factors such as family background or social class.
		- Equality of Opportunity: In a truly meritocratic society, everyone should have an equal opportunity to succeed, irrespective of their starting point.
	- One metric that is commonly used to determine one's success is their income bracket expressed as percentile of population
	- Social mobility and meritocracy
		- Social mobility is a critical measure of meritocracy, illustrating the extent to which individuals can rise above their initial socio-economic status
		- Social mobility indicates fairness and equal opportunities
- Argument: Singapore has high social mobility and can be considered meritocratic
	- Ministry of Finance 2015 White paper 
	- A large percentage of bottom 20% reach top quintile
		- Strong indicator of high social mobility
	- The 50th percentile is in the 3rd quintile - Bottom 20% can reach median quintile
		- Indicate that despite being in the bottom 20%, on average, most can reach Singapore median income
	- Family's socioeconomic background does not affect a child's ability to succeed
- Counter-Argument
	- Weaknesses of social mobility as a metric
		- When expressed as a percentage of the population, may be a relative measure, and achieving success doesn't necessarily mean absolute improvement.
		- Does not consider other income brackets
			- How much of the top 20% stay as the top 20-40%?
			- Exacerbated by Singapore's high income inequality and education inequality (https://karyawan.sg/social-mobility-in-singapore/#:~:text=Singapore%20ranked%2020th%20out,consumption%20inequality%2C%20and%20education%20inequality.)
	- Outdatedness of arguments
		- 1978-1982 cohort, Measured from 2008-2012
		- Difficult to measure over a long period
		- Many factors have changed
			- Tuition
				- Increased spending on tuition $88.40 per month per household (https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/tuition-has-ballooned-s14b-industry-singapore-should-we-be-concerned)
				- Lower income households may not be able to afford this
			- See "Other Resources" for additional substantiation and depth
			- ~~Impact of Technology~~ (Remove this part; Insufficient depth)
				- [~~ref~~](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/how-home-based-learning-hbl-shows-up-inequality-in-singapore-a-look-at-three-homes)
				- ~~Diminished learning experiences compared to those with conducive studying space in their own homes~~
				- ~~Technological disparities, as highlighted in home-based learning experiences, may contribute to unequal educational opportunities~~
- Conclusion
	- Based on existing research, we conclude that Singapore is meritocratic for the generation before us who were born in 1978-1982
	- It is unclear whether this is still true for the current generation

- OECD reports that Singapore students score well but tend to intensify socioeconomic inequality
	- **Page 4**: Specifically "early tracking of students; focus on academic results; segregation of students into different schools by academic performance; segregation of socioeconomically advantaged and disadvantaged students into different schools"
- How tuition and costs has disadvantaged the lower income.  The higher income parents even guide and monitor their children
	- **Page 13**: "In 2017/18, monthly expenditure on private tuition and other educational courses varied widely by household income: households in the 1st to 20th percentiles spent S$45.30 per month. Relative to this, those in the 21st to 40th percentile spent 1.7 times the amount (S$75.80); those in the 41st to 60th percentiles 2.7 times (S$121.20); those in the 61st to 80th percentiles 3.4 times (S$152.60); and those in the 81st to 100th percentiles 3.7 times (S$167) (Department of Statistics, 2018)"
- Children from low-income families fall behind when they start primary school
	- **Page 16**: "They are less advanced than kids from wealthier families, who are often better prepared—through kindergarten, enrichment classes, and home learning—to read and write."

## Draft Paragraphs
### Argument: Singapore still has a high social mobility which indicates irrelevance between household SES and "success" 
Ministry of Finance released a White Paper in 2015 which revealed compelling statistics that shed light on the upward mobility of Singaporeans. Notably, a substantial percentage of individuals who started in the bottom 20% managed to move to the median quintile. This data stands as a testament to the idea that, on average, even those from less privileged backgrounds in Singapore have the potential to elevate themselves economically.

Furthermore, the study delved deeper, revealing that a considerable proportion of those who began in the bottom 20% eventually reached the top quintile. This is a indicator of a society where one's socio-economic starting point does not necessarily dictate their long-term financial standing. It suggests that Singapore fosters an environment where talent and effort can allow individuals from the lowest income bracket to move into the highest income bracket.
### Counter 1: Social Mobility as a Metric
One critical limitation lies in the concept of relative success. Social mobility, when expressed as a percentage of the population, might inadvertently promote a relative view of success. Individuals might be considered successful if they surpass their peers, but this doesn't guarantee an improvement in absolute terms. In a truly meritocratic society, success should not be contingent on outperforming others but rather on achieving one's potential.

Moreover, social mobility metrics often focus on the movement from the bottom to the middle or top percentiles. However, this overlooks the stability within these upper brackets. It is essential to question how many of those who are in the top 20% manage to sustain their position over time. A meritocratic society should not only facilitate upward mobility but also fairness among all income groups. A perfectly meritocratic society should also examine how the initial top 20% income is distributed across various income quintiles, preventing a "rich get richer" problem.

While social mobility is a valuable metric, its limitations should caution us against solely relying on it to gauge the extent of meritocracy in Singapore. The emphasis should shift towards not just relative success but the distribution and sustainability of success across all income brackets for a more comprehensive evaluation of meritocracy.
### Counter 2: Outdatedness of Data
The choice of the 1978-1982 cohort, while informative for its historical context, raises questions about its applicability to the present generation. Singapore, since that period, has undergone changes in various aspects, such as education, technology, and societal expectations.

One critical aspect often overlooked is the increased costs of education. The 1978-1982 cohort might have experienced a different educational landscape, with potentially more affordable pathways to academic success. On the contrary, today's students face a different reality, with tuition costs becoming a substantial financial burden for many. As highlighted by recent studies, the increased spending on tuition, now averaging $88.40 per month per household, potentially places education out of reach for lower-income families. This financial barrier challenges the narrative of equal opportunities and questions the meritocracy of the current educational system. (Potentially add additional elaboration and resource)


## Consultation
- Definition of meritocracy: Make it clear into one item. What's the link between 2 people
- Counter-argument
	- Nature of measure
	- Consider MOF absolute improvement
- Consider other countries e.g. WEF
	- Go into it more and see if we can get more insights
- Remove MOF paper if possible
- One way to go deeper is to have more aspects
	- More studies is fine to get into a 
- Do not go beyond 2 studies for oral pitch
- Use 1-2 pillars on WEF and zoom in on that
	- Can critique on WEF methodology
		- Some are on outcomes and some on policies
	-  Use Tou You Yenn study to focus on education
- In intro, scope it into education
- At end of analysis, tie back to definition of meritocracy
