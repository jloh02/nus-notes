## All Animals are Equal
### Summary
- "Basic principle of equality is equality of consideration"
- Despite differences in humans, we demand equality. Therefore the demand for equality differs from equality of all humans
- Using any factual measure of some and saying it is not a judge of a persons ability does not work
	- Inequality towards those with lesser ability
	- Characteristics should not be used to justify equality
- Argues against speciesism
- "Equality is a moral ideal, not a simple assertion of fact"
- "The principle of the equality of human beings is not a description of an alleged actual equality among humans: It is a prescription of how we should treat humans"
- The difference from animals to humans is continuum with overlaps between various species

### Arguments to Make
- Drawing the line at sentience?
	- Contradicts Singer's own point that we cannot base equality on an "assertion of fact"
		- We are drawing lines to something that is sentient
	- Some may argue plants are [sentient](https://www.nathab.com/blog/research-shows-plants-are-sentient-will-we-act-accordingly/)
		- Have the ability to react to environments
	- With that in response, we should have equal consideration between plants, animals and humans
		- From a nutritional point of view, consuming animals and plants would require similar consideration
		- It does not matter whether we consume animals, plants or humans for survival
	- Propose that aligning with Singer's idea that equality should not be on factual lines, it can only be placed in arbitrary subjective terms 
		- This would be how similar they are to us
			- Sentiency
			- Species
		- Dogs having a similar level of consciousness/sentience and thus we treat them closer to humans
- Objective of discussing equality
	- Provide equal opportunity to groups that would otherwise be marginalized
		- Equal opportunity
		- Unequal treatment
	- Singer's example of what happens if we prove a certain discrimination to be better 
		- There will still be equal consideration, despite unequal treatment
		- Equality is typically discuss with regard to income inequality or unequal opportunities to the disadvantaged
		- Our purpose of equality is to provide equal opportunity
- No matter what line we use to draw equality, similar to speciesism, the level of equality can be said to be a continuum (aligns with Singer's later arguments). It strongly depends on our purpose of discussing equality - if we think that humans should be equal. No matter what arbitrary line we determine, it is bound to be biased. And any argument otherwise can be said to be brought to absurd degrees to render useless.

## Response

In Peter Singer's essay, "All Animals are Equal", he argues that equality should not be confined to identical treatment, but rather equal moral consideration. Singer extends this concept to include animals, arguing that if humans deserve equal moral consideration due to their sentience, animals should similarly receive such consideration. In doing so, Singer challenges the notion of speciesism as a valid determinant of equality, suggesting that the differences between humans and animals should be viewed as a continuum rather than a rigid categorical divide.

However, while Singer's call for increased ethical consideration for animals, his conclusion that animals should be regarded as equal to humans presents significant challenges. This critique proposes that equality itself should be viewed as a spectrum, with degrees of equality determined by several factors, including sentience, cognitive ability, and emotional connection. 

Singer's arguments appear to contradicts itself when he argues that equality should not be treated as an "assertion of fact" while simultaneously advocating for equal consideration between humans and animals based on sentience. This approach fails to acknowledge differences in cognitive abilities among different animal species, over simplifying the sentiency argument into a categorical distinction - either an entity is sentient or not. Moreover, drawing parallels between speciesism to racism and sexism overlooks essential distinctions between these forms of discrimination. It also results in the exclusion of non-sentient entities such as plants from moral consideration.

Nevertheless, Singer's assertion that equality should not be arbitrarily determined remains valid when equality is viewed as a spectrum defined by sentience, cognitive ability, and emotional connection. For example, humans often perceive dogs as more equal to humans than pigs due to perceived cognitive similarities. Dogs can adapt their behavior to coexist with humans, and some can even understand human needs. Therefore, dogs' ability to emotionally connect with humans makes humans perceive them as more equal than pigs. While it is generally accepted that consuming pork is moral, consuming dog meat is not. In addition, to account for inequality towards plants, it can be argued that, since they possess no sentience and arguably limited cognitive ability, plants do not deserve equal consideration. This approach aligns with Singer's intention to extend equal consideration to all sentient beings.

This perspective inevitably raises the issue if humans with severe cognitive impairments should be considered equal to humans due to their reduced cognitive ability and potentially emotional ability. However, when we consider that they are sentient and can often still emotionally interact with humans, we can justify extending equal consideration to these individuals.

Nonetheless, it is crucial to consider the context and purpose of equality when determining which entities should be considered equal. To avoid reaching absurd conclusions where all organisms are granted equal moral status, from plants to humans, it is important to establish parameters for equal consideration based on the degree of similarity in cognitive and emotional ability. This approach allows us to define the circumstances in which certain groups or entities should be regarded as equals, thus preserving the essence of Singer's argument.

In conclusion, while Peter Singer's call for equal consideration of animals is compelling, his approach encounters difficulties when advocating for the complete equality of all animals and humans. By adopting a spectrum-based approach that considers sentience and emotional ability, we can achieve a more balanced and nuanced understanding of equality. This approach recognizes the complexities of moral consideration and allows us to make more informed ethical judgments when considering human-animal relationships.
