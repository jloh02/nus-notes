- Should merit includes the effects of luck?
- If we take meritocracy as a system where people are only judged on what is within their control?
	- i.e. by luck

## Measures of Meritocracy
- Social Mobility
	- Regardless of parental wealth
	- Ease of movement across social class
	- Perfectly immobile: Poor family, poor all your life
	- Perfectly mobile: Zero correlation between wealth and success
- Inter generational Income Elasticity
	- Based on work by Prof Gary Solon
	- Misses out on non-tangible aspects
	- High income tax, easy access to good education, strong unions

### Kinds of Mobility
- Absolute Mobility
	- Real median monthly income between parent and child
- Relative Mobility
	- How many in the bottom 20% income moved into each quintile
	- Using income does not account for effort, wealth and quality of life
		- Does not consider current economic conditions

## Singapore's Meritocracy
- 40% of students in top 6 primary schools stay in HDB
- Intergenerational Earnings Mobility in Singapore is moderately low
	- Similar to US due to similar economic policies, welfare systems, education regimes and labor structures
- Singapore ranked 20 in a study
	- Concerns regarding education equity metrics
		- Focus on minimum/average - Does not factor in wealth advantage 
		- Quality of education in more expensive preschools
		- Enrichment classes
	- Useful datapoint but need more studies
- Study on social capital in Singapore (Institute of Policy Studies, 2017)
	- Impact of social stratification on meritocracy
		- Closed social networks with vast differences in resources
		- Reduced inter-class understanding, risk of distorted perception of merits
		- Weakened collective bonds, hampering collective strengthening meritocracy
