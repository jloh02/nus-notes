>What is merit, and to what extent is Singapore meritocratic? Discuss with reference to at least 2 studies.
## Outline
- Define Meritocracy
	- Individual Agency and Success: Meritocracy posits that individual success is determined primarily by personal effort, inherent abilities, and talent rather than external factors such as family background or social class
	- Equality of Opportunity: In a truly meritocratic society, everyone should have an equal opportunity to succeed, irrespective of their starting point
	- Link the 2 points together
- Scope to education and wages
	- Equal opportunity to learn
	- Outcome will be measured in income
	- Ability to change income --> Social mobility
- Social mobility and meritocracy
	- Social mobility is a critical measure of meritocracy, illustrating the extent to which individuals can rise above their initial socio-economic status
	- Social mobility indicates fairness and equal opportunities
- WEF SMI Report in 2020
	- Briefly recap what we covered in class
	- Singapore ranked 20
	- Pillar 2 Education access: Quality of vocational training, Out-of-school children, Inequality-adjusted education index
		- The barrier to education for children is low; Equal opportunity for all children to access educational resources
	- Pillar 3 Education Quality and Equity: Children below minimum proficiency, Percentage of disadvantaged students in schools which report a lack of education material
		- Less than 3% below minimum proficiency
		- All disadvantaged students do not report a lack of education material
			- Counter: Disadvantaged students
	- However, Pillar 7: Fair Wage Distribution
		- Score 45
		- Ratio of bottom 40% to top 10% labour income share 48.0 
		- Ratio of bottom 50% to top 50% labour income share 25.7
		- Undermines relative social mobility; Typically, the outcome of a meritocratic system is high social mobility which should indicate fair income/wages
	- Further shown in social mobility vs gini coefficient graph
		- For such a high social mobility score, Singapore has a very high gini coefficient
		- High Gini coefficients indicate a concentration of wealth and income in the hands of a few, suggesting that economic advantages are not distributed based on merit
		- Further suggested in Teo Yeo Yenn's Paper

- Teo You Yenn's "Educational Inequality and Development"
	- OECD reports that Singapore students score well but tend to intensify socioeconomic inequality
		- **Page 4**: Specifically "early tracking of students; focus on academic results; segregation of students into different schools by academic performance; segregation of socioeconomically advantaged and disadvantaged students into different schools"
	- **Page 5**: Ong Xiang Ling and Cheung Hoi Shan found in a study that—as measured by parents’ educational attainment, housing type, and monthly per capita household income—students in “elite” schools are disproportionately from higher socioeconomic status households compared to students from “neighborhood” schools (Ong and Cheung, 2016)
		- Teo You Yenn correlates "elite" schools to people who typically have a higher chance of "success"
		- Suggests that students' socioeconomic background still largely affects one's achievements and educational outcomes/income
	- To put this in numbers, the OECD report refers to the commonly known PISA results
		- Singapore is top in maths, science and reading in PISA 2015
		- PISA also measures the performance of low economic, social and cultural status (ESCS)
			- Singapore is ranked among the 5 countries that has the highest likelihood of low ESCS students performing at a level 2 or below (Total 6 levels. Level 2 is bottom 10 percentile)
		- Singapore's education system further exacerbates the income inequality problem as students with low socioeconomic statuses tend to perform worse in the PISA test (a measure of the outcome) --> Suggests Singapore is not meritocratic
		- Perform worse in school may lead to lower incomes --> Vicious cycle
