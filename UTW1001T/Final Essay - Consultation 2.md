## Intro
Singapore's Minister of Education Chan Chun Sing describes meritocracy as “a core pillar of Singapore's survival and success” (Forward Singapore, 2023). The principle, integral to the nation’s socio-political landscape, is a subject of ongoing debate among leaders, parents and students who question the true meritocratic nature of the education system.

When examining Singapore’s educational landscape, it appears to be meritocratic, however, the inequitable outcomes may challenge this idea.

## Social Mobility & Education Access


## Education Quality & Equity

### Concern on disadvantaged students
- Some disadvantaged students may not recognize the inadequacy of their resources compared to their higher-performing peers. For example, some may believe that additional tuition is unnecessary. 
- 2018 Household Expenditure Survey
	- top quintile of households by resident household income spends 3.7 times as much on private tuition as compared to the bottom quintile
	- Large difference in spending on private tuition between households of varying socioeconomic statuses
	- Lower income families may be less willing to make such investments, assuming regular schooling suffices, resulting in different education quality


### Concern on using standard age of 10 for academic proficiency
- Teo Yeo Yenn paper “early tracking of students; focus on academic results; segregation of students into different schools by academic performance; segregation of socioeconomically advantaged and disadvantaged students into different schools,” all contributing to variations in educational quality


## Study on Elite vs Neighborhood School Disproportion
- a stark disproportion of higher socioeconomic students in “elite” schools as compared to “neighborhood” schools (Ong Xiang Ling and Cheung Hoi Shan)
- While this is not a direct measure of success such as income, students from these schools are expected to have more favorable long-term outcomes, which diverges from meritocratic principles


## PISA Report 2015
- low economic social and cultural status (ESCS) students in Singapore are 4 times more likely to perform below the minimum proficiency level (global bottom 10 percentile)
- Exacerbate income inequality
- Success should be independent of family socioeconomic status


### Transition to Outcomes (Income)
These criticisms question the veracity of equal opportunities within Singapore's education system. The meritocratic principles guiding the system seem compromised, as success becomes increasingly dependent on family background rather than individual merit. Moreover, the distribution of outcomes, measured by income, may not align with notions of fairness.

## Fair Wage Distribution
- The disparity between the top 10% to bottom 40% labor income share (48.0) and the top 50% to bottom 50% (25.7) signals significant income inequality despite the commendable education system
- The consistency raises questions about the practical effectiveness of Singapore's meritocratic principles, as a core outcome of meritocracy should be social mobility leading to fair incomes and wages.

Singapore's divergence from this pattern suggests a concentration of wealth in the hands of the rich. In a truly meritocratic society, opportunities, and rewards, including income, should be equitably distributed, and this statistical anomaly implies that economic advantages may not be solely based on merit.


## Education Support
While some argue that Singapore’s education support mitigates unequal opportunities, the outcomes demonstrate a largely unequal distribution of success, be it measure by income or educational opportunities. This disparity, emphasized in Teo Yeo Yenn’s recent study, questions the efficacy of government efforts to combat inequality, suggesting that the root cause may outweigh the impact of education support.

## Indirect Representation of Rewards through Wages
- it does not consider lower effort in the workplace, leading to lower performance, and hence, justly lower wages
- other short-term evidence such as the disproportionately high ratio of high socioeconomic status students in “elite” schools and the increased likelihood of low performance by low ESCS students support the notion that rewards may not be distributed equitably


## Effort
- the expectation is that efforts would be evenly distributed among the large student population in Singapore
- unequal distribution of results as indicated by income inequality and early segregation of students into “elite” schools, contradicts the meritocratic ideal.

> Add why even if effort is uneven, it could be due to unfairness in the system, causing lack of motivation.
> System causes lesser effort also? 

## Conclusion
In conclusion, Singapore's state-controlled education policies may seemingly support meritocracy by offering equal opportunities. However, the actual outcomes challenge this ideal. In the short term, students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds increase their education quality through private tuition. This inevitably channels them into “elite” schools, setting the stage for long-term effects such as income inequality and unfair wages. These issues exacerbate social immobility and undermine the meritocratic principles. While Singapore has taken notable strides in providing equal access to education and resources, the results indicate that they are insufficient. Perhaps, amidst the competitive nature of Singapore’s education system, a cultural shift away from an excessive focus on academics and a restructuring of the education system to reduce segregation, might enhance the meritocracy of the system. However, achieving this without limiting the potential of higher-performing students poses a considerable challenge.
