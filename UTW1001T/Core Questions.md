1. When, if ever, is inequality just?
2. What should we do about actual wealth inequality?


Discuss philosophy, not psychology


When discussing ethics, avoid causal effect (Avoid explanations and give justifications): Do not discuss other's circumstances or beliefs. e.g. "This is wrong if the person was brought up this way" or "The death penalty is moral to those whose love ones have been murdered"

To resolve our conflicts:
1. Identify conflicts and resolve them
2. Test the variables
3. Reasoning through parallels


## Opening Question

**Should billionaires exist?**

From a utilitarian point of view, to maximize the happiness of all parties involved, billionaires should not exist. Despite their extravagant lifestyles, billionaires also allocate their vast wealth to investments, seeking to further increase their wealth. This behaviour can be seen as a diminishing marginal return in terms of happiness as every dollar they receive gives them less satisfaction. Meanwhile, a significant portion of the global population struggles with access to basic necessities and live in poor living conditions. The redistributing of billionaires' excess wealth to those in need could result in a more equal distribution of happiness.

However, it can also be argued that billionaires have the financial means to impact philanthropic organizations and help those in need. Prominent billionaires such as Warren Buffet and Bill Gates have demonstrated their ability to address some of these societal issues through their philanthropic efforts. In addition, removing the existence of billionaires may lead to a significant number of middle-income individuals who lack the financial means to contribute to philanthropic causes and undermines the goal of minimizing suffering.

Personally, I lean towards the notion that the existence billionaires is ethically problematic. While there are many billionaire philanthropists, the persistence of global issues regarding poverty and income inequality suggest that these efforts are insufficient. Redistributing their wealth through aggressive taxation policies rather than voluntary donations may address this issue - that is assuming that governments effectively use it to bridge the income inequality gap.
