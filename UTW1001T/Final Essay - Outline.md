## Introduction

- On 12 June 2023, Singapore's Minister of Education Chan Chun Sing describes meritocracy as "a core pillar of Singapore's survival and success"
	- https://www.forwardsingapore.gov.sg/stories/revisiting-meritocracy
- Meritocracy lies at the very heart of Singapore's socio-political landscape. Singapore's leaders, parents and students often debate on meritocracy and if our education system is truly meritocratic
- Although meritocracy is an idealistic outcome, in the context of education, we can split into 2 components: equal opportunities and equitable distribution of outcomes
	- Meritocracy focuses on the provision of equal opportunities to all individuals, irrespective of their background, or socioeconomic status. For education, it implies that every individual should have access to the same educational resources, and equal opportunity to develop their skills and abilities
	- A truly meritocratic system should ensure that those who work hard and excel are recognized and rewarded, this outcome is often quantified by income
## Social Mobility and WEF Report
- Consider social mobility as a metric to assess the influence of socioeconomic backgrounds on income
- WEF Social Mobility Report in 2020
	- Singapore is 20th among 80 countries indicating a relatively high degree of social mobility
	- Singapore performs well in both the Education Access Pillar and the Education Quality and Equity Pillar
## Providing Equal Opportunity
### Education Access
- WEF Report Results
	- 8th in the world
	- <0.1% of adolescents and young adults who are out-of-school
	- Singapore's dedication to keeping children in school and ensuring equal access to education
	- Reduces educational disparities, as children in Singapore enjoy basic access to education
- Counter-arguments
	- Vague definition of adolescents and young adults who are out of school can obscure the true picture of Singapore's educational landscape
		- Particularly given Singapore's multi-path education system
### Education Quality and Equity
- WEF Report Results
	- 2.7% of children below minimum proficiency level
		- Relatively high standard of education when compared to other countries
	- No disadvantaged students report a lack of educational materials
		- Underprivileged students possess ample resources to excel
- Counter-arguments
	- Subjective nature of metrics related to the sufficiency of educational materials for underprivileged students
		- Disadvantaged students may not always recognize the insufficiency of their resources compared to their higher-performing peers
	- Teo Yeo Yenn's Reasons For Education Inequality
		- "early tracking of students; focus on academic results; segregation of students into different schools by academic performance; segregation of socioeconomically advantaged and disadvantaged students into different schools"
		- Students in "elite" schools are disproportionately from higher socioeconomic status households compared to those in "neighbourhood" schools
		- While this is not a direct measure of success such as income, students from these schools are expected to have more favorable long-term outcomes, diverging from the meritocratic principles
	- Academic Proficiency
		- Standard age of 10 to assess children's academic proficiency may not fully capture the complexities of Singapore's education system
		- Educational proficiency can fluctuate significantly as students age
		- Reference Teo Yeo Yenn "Early tracking of students"
			- Significantly changes students' proficiency as they age, further exacerbating this problem
	- OECD PISA Results for Low ESCS
		- Low ESCS Students in Singapore are 4x more likely to perform in global bottom 10 percentile (below minimum proficiency)
		-  Singapore's education system exacerbates income inequality, creating a cycle where students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds tend to underperform academically, potentially leading to lower-income jobs in the future
		- Misalignment contradicts the meritocratic ideal, as success becomes highly dependent on family socioeconomic status
## Unequal Outcomes
### Fair Wage Distribution
- WEF Report Results
	- 51st of 80 countries
	- Ratios of labor income share
		- Top 10% to bottom 40%: 48.0
		- Top 50% to bottom 50%: 25.7
	- Significant income inequality despite the commendable education system
- This raises questions about the effectiveness of Singapore's meritocratic principles in practice, as a core outcome of meritocracy should be social mobility leading to fair incomes and wages

### WEF SMI vs Gini
> This is to question the reliability of Social Mobility to determine meritocracy

- Compare Singapore's income inequality with other countries
- A country with a higher Social Mobility Index (SMI) should ideally exhibit a lower Gini coefficient, representing a more equitable distribution of wealth
- Singapore has a high SMI score of 75 but when compared with countries with similar SMI (UK, Australia and New Zealand), Singapore has a disproportionately high Gini coefficient
	- High Gini coefficient suggests a concentration of wealth in the hands of the rich, implying that economic advantages may not be distributed purely based on merit
- Link between Gini and Meritocracy: In a truly meritocratic society, there should be more equal distribution of opportunities and rewards, and thus equal distribution of income
## Counter Argument: Additional Education Support
- Some may argue that additional education support helps to alleviate this issue
- The result still show a significant disparity 
- Teo Yeo Yenn's paper is still relatively recent in 2022
	- Impacts of such education support is questionable and may far outweigh 

## Limitation: Using Income as a Measure of Success 
- Wages may not directly represent Singapore's education system as there is gap between wages and education (Workplace performance)

## Limitation: Accounting for Effort vs Blaming the System
- Some may attribute the lack of income inequality and social mobility to the effort of students rather than the education system
- Whilst this paper does not account for effort of students, one should expect that efforts should be rather evenly distributed given the large number of students in Singapore
- Despite this, the excessively unequal distribution of results as shown from the SMI, income inequality and early segregation of students into "better" schools, contradict the meritocratic ideal

## Conclusion

- Singapore's state-controlled education policies may, on the surface, appear to support meritocracy by providing equal opportunities to students
- Actual outcomes contradict this ideal
	- Short term: Students from higher socioeconomic backgrounds are channeled into "better" schools
	- Long term: Income inequality and unfair wages
	- Exacerbate social immobility and undermine the principles of meritocracy
- While Singapore's education system has made notable strides in providing equal access to education and resources
	- Results evidently show they are insufficient
	- Perhaps as the 4 factors proposed in Teo Yeo Yenn's paper, a cultural change is required to reduce the focus on academics and a change in Singapore's education system to reduce segregation
	- Challenge: Limiting potential of higher performing students
