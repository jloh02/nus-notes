**Size of Matrix:** No. of rows x No. of col

## Theorem
A linear system is consistent if and only if the rightmost column of the augmented matrix is not a pivot column, ie, if and only if an echelon form of the augmented matrix does not have row of the form `[0 0 ... 0 b]` with nonzero `b`
## REF and RREF
A rectangular matrix is in echelon form (REF) if:
1. All non-zero rows are above any rows of all 0s.
2. Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it
3. All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros **(Each pivot should have only 0s above it)**

A matrix is in reduced echelon form (or reduced row echelon form) if it satisfies REF and :
1. The leading entry in each nonzero row is 1
2. Each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in its column

### Steps
1. Start with leftmost nonzero column as pivot column
2. Select nonzero entry in pivot column as pivot
3. Use replacement operations to create 0s in positions below pivot (Basically manual REF in JC)
4. Cover all rows as necessary below the pivot and repeat for all columns
5. Starting with **rightmost pivot** and working **upwards** to the left, create 0s above each pivot

## Matrix Transformation Syntax
- Subtract $2R_3$ from $R_2$
- Swap $R_2$ with $R_1$

$\left(\begin{array}{cc\|c}1&3&5\\2&2&6\\1&1&1\end{array}\right)\xrightarrow{R_2-2R_3}\ \xrightarrow{R_2\leftrightarrow R_1}$

## Pivots
- Pivot position: A location in matrix $A$ that corresponds to a leading 1 in REF of $A$
- Pivot column: A column of matrix $A$ that contains a pivot position

### Example
$\begin{pmatrix}1&4&5&-9&-7\\0&2&4&-6&-6\\0&0&0&-5&0\\0&0&0&0&0\end{pmatrix}$

Pivot Columns are 1,2,4
Pivots are 1,2,-5

### Free and Basic Variables
- Basic Variable: Corresponds to pivots in the matrix
- Free Variable: Does not correspond to a pivot

## Representations

### Parametric Equation

"Normal Form"

$$
\begin{align}
5x + 3y = 2 \\
12x + y = 15
\end{align}
$$

Note: Whenever a system is consistent and has free variables, the solution set has many parametric descriptions.

### Matrix Equation

$Ax = b$


$$
\begin{align}
\begin{pmatrix}1&2&2\\3&-1&2\\2&3&2\\3&3&0\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}x\\y\\z\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}2\\1\\3\\1\end{pmatrix} \rightarrow \\ x\begin{pmatrix}1\\3\\2\\3\end{pmatrix}+y\begin{pmatrix}2\\-1\\0\\3\end{pmatrix}+z\begin{pmatrix}2\\2\\2\\0\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}2\\1\\3\\1\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
$$


A vector with two entries is $w=\begin{pmatrix}w_1\\w_2\end{pmatrix}$ where $w_1$ and $w_2$ are any real numbers. The set of all vectors with 2 entries is denoted by $\mathbb{R}^2$

#### Span {$v$}
Span {$v$} can geometrically be a line in 3D plane if $v$ is a 3x1 matrix

If $v_1, v_2 ... v_p$ are in $\mathbb {R}^n$ , then the set of all linear combinations of $v_1, v_2 ... v_p$ is denoted by  $Span\{v_1, v_2 ... v_p\}$ and is called the subset of spanned (or generated) by $v_1, v_2 ... v_p$.

$Span\{v_1, v_2 ... v_p\} = \{ c_1v_1 +c_2v_2 +...+c_pv_p âˆ¶ c_1,...,c_p\}$ are scalars

Geometric Description of $Span\{v,u\}$
- Contains line through u and 0
- Contains line through v and 0
- Provided v and u are NOT parallel

#### Solutions of Matrix Equation
$$
Ax = \begin{pmatrix}|&|&...&|\\a_1&a_2&...&a_n\\|&|&...&|\end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}x_1\\x_2\\...\\x_n\end{pmatrix} = x_1a_1 + x_2a_2 + ... + x_n a_n = b
$$
Number of columns in A = Number of entries in x

Solution set of system of linear equations with augmented matrix
$$
\left(
\begin{matrix}|&|&...&|\\a_1&a_2&...&a_n\\|&|&...&|\end{matrix} 
\right.
\left|
\begin{matrix}|\\b\\|\end{matrix}
\right)
$$
- For each $b$ in $\mathbb{R}^m$, the equation $Ax=b$ has a solution

#### Homogenous Linear System
Linear system of equations can be written in the form $Ax=0$, where $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $0$ is the zero vector in $\mathbb{R}^m$

$$
\begin{align}
Ax &= 0\\
(A|0) &= 
\left(
\begin{matrix} 3 & 5 & -4 \\-3 & -2 & 4\\6 & 1 & -8\end{matrix}
\left|
\begin{matrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{matrix}
\right.
\right)
\end{align}
$$

- The solution for $Ax = 0$ always contains $x=0$ (Trivial solution)
- The equation $Ax = 0$ only has a nontrivial/nonzero solution if there is 1 free variable
	- i.e. It *must* not be invertible

#### Non Homogenous Linear Systems
**IMPORTANT**
(Solutions of $Ax = b$) is equal to ($p + (\text{Solutions of }A_x = 0)$)

##### Solutions Represented in Parametric Vector Form
Parametric vector equation of line: $x = tv, t \in \mathbb{R}$
Parametric vector equation of plane: $x = su + tv,\ s, t \in \mathbb{R}$  

When a <ins>nonhomogeneous linear system has many solutions</ins>,  general solution can be written in parametric vector form as one vector plus an arbitrary linear combination of vectors that satisfy the corresponding homogeneous system
##### Steps
1. RREF augmented matrix
2. Express each basic variable as free variables
3. Write a solution as a vector whose entries depend on free variables (Refer to last line below)
4. Decompose solution into linear combination of vectors

$$
\begin{align}
A &= \begin{pmatrix} 3 & 5 & -4 \\ -3 & -2 & 4 \\ 6 & 1 & -8 \end{pmatrix} \\
b &= \begin{pmatrix} 7\\-1\\-4 \end{pmatrix} \\
(A|b) &= \left(
\begin{matrix}
1 & 0 & -\frac{4}{3} \\
0&1&0 \\
0&0&0
\end{matrix}
\right.
\left|
\begin{matrix} 
-1\\2\\0
\end{matrix}
\right)
\\
x &= \begin{pmatrix}-1\\2\\0\end{pmatrix} + x_3\begin{pmatrix}\frac{4}{3}\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}
\end{align}
