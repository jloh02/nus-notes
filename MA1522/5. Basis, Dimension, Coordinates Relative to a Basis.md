## Basis
- Every vector $v \in V$ can be written as a linear combination of vectors in S <ins>uniquely</ins>
### Syntax
$[v]_s = \begin{pmatrix}1\\1\end{pmatrix}$
$v$ relative to basis $s$ is the above matrix
### Requirements
Let $V \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a subspace. Set $S = \{u_1,... u_k\} \subseteq V$ is a basis for V if 
- span(S) = V
- S is linearly independent
	- To check, RREF a matrix of S and ensure pivot columns (no non-zero rows)
### Equivalent Statements for Invertibility
1. The RREF of $A$ is the identity matrix
2. $A$ can be expressed as a product of elementary matrices
3. The homogenous system $Ax=0$ has only the trivial solution
4. For any b, the system $Ax=b$ has a unique solution
5. $det(A) \neq 0$
6. The columns/rows of $A$ are linearly independent
7. The columns/rows of $A$ span $\mathbb{R}^n$
### Dimensions of Solution Space
$V = \{ u \in \mathbb{R}^n | Au = 0\}$
Number of non-pivot columns in RREF of A = $dim(V)$
#### Properties
- If $U \subseteq V$, $dim(U) \leq dim(V)$
- If $U \subseteq V$, $U \neq V$, $dim(U) \lt dim(V)$
### Methods to Check for Basis
Let $V\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ be a $k$ dimensional subspace ($k = dim(V)$)
1. Check that $|S| = k$ and $S \subseteq V$ and $S$ is linearly independent , then $S$ is a basis for $V$
	- Don't need to check for $span(S) = V$
	- Good to use this with implicit formula
2. Check that $V \subseteq span(S)$ and $|S| = k$, then $S$ is a basis for $V$
	- Don't need to check for $span(S) \subseteq V$ and $S$ linear independence
