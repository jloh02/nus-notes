"Length of Vector" = Norm = $||u|| = \sqrt{u\cdot u}$
Unit Vector: $||u|| = 1$
Normalize using $\frac{u}{||u||}$

### Orthogonal & Orthonormal

Angle between vectors
$$
cos(\theta) = \frac{u\cdot v}{||u||||v||}
$$

Orthogonal if $u \cdot v = 0$
Orthonormal if orthogonal **and** $u \cdot u = 0$

- Orthogonal set of nonzero vectors is linearly independent
- Any orthogonal set containing $n$ nonzero vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an orthogonal basis
- Any orthonormal set containing $n$ vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is an orthonormal basis

If $S = \{u_1,u_2,...\}$ is an orthogonal basis for subspace V, for any $v \in V$
$$
[v]_s = \begin{pmatrix}\frac{v\cdot u_1}{||u_1||^2}\\\frac{v\cdot u_2}{||u_2||^2}\\...\end{pmatrix}
$$

- Orthogonal complement: 2 subspaces that when added together give you span of entire subspace
	- Orthogonal complement of line is a plane and vice versa

### Orthogonal Projection
- Each vector $w$ on a plane can consist of $w_p$ (a projection along the plane) and $w_n$ (normal to the plane) 

### Gram-Schmidt Process
- To construct a orthogonal basis using a linear independent set

1. Let $v_1$ = $u_1$
2. $v_2 = u_2 - \frac{v_1\cdot u_2}{||v_1||^2} v_1$ (Remove the projection from other vectors to get normal to previous)
3. $v_3 = u_3 - \frac{v_1\cdot u_3}{||v_1||^2} v_1 - \frac{v_2\cdot u_3}{||v_2||^2} v_2$ (Remove the projection from other vectors to get normal to previous)
4. Repeat for each vector $v_k = u_k - \frac{v_1\cdot u_k}{||v_1||^2} v_1 - \frac{v_2\cdot u_k}{||v_2||^2} v_2 ...$

### Orthogonal Matrix
Square matrix of order $n$ is an orthogonal matrix if $A^T = A^{-1}$
- Columns and rows form an **orthonormal** basis for $\mathbb{R}^n$

### QR Factorization
- When $rank(A) = n$
- Perform Gram-Schmidt with normalization to get orthonormal set
- Put orthonormal set vectors as columns of $Q$ matrix
- Solve for $R = Q^TA$, change $q_j$ to $-q_j$ to ensure that $R$ has positive diagonal entries
	- R will be an upper triangular matrix

Properties of QR Matrix
- $Q^TQ = I_n$
- Upper triangular matrix R is invertible

### Least Square Approximation
- $||Au-b|| \leq ||Av-b||$ for any $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$
- Solve for $Ax = \text{proj }b\text{ onto }Col(A)$
- Solve for $A^TAu=A^Tb$ (Will always be consistent and **a** least square solution)

$u = R^{-1}Q^Tb$

$Rx = Q^Tb$
