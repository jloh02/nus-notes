## Eigenvalues

$Av = \lambda v, v\in \mathbb{R}^n, v\neq 0, \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$
$\lambda$: Eigenvalue
$v$: Eigenvector

- $n\times n$ matrix can have at most $n$ eigenvalues
- The eigenvalues of a triangular matrix are the diagonal entries
	- The algebraic multiplicity is the number of times each eigenvalue appears along the diagonal
### Characteristic Polynomial
$char(A) = det(xI-A)$

$\lambda = \text{Roots of } char(A)$

### Algebraic Multiplicity
$r_\lambda$:The highest power of the $char(A)$ polynomial factorized

## Eigenvector

$(A^TA)^{-1}A^Tw$ is the least squares solution
$A(A^TA)^{-1}A^Tw$ is the projection of $w$ onto $V$ 

### Eigenspace
- Collection of all eigenvectors with the zero vector to become subspace
- $E_\lambda = \{v\in\mathbb{R}^n | Av=\lambda v\} = Null(\lambda I-A)$
- To find, substitute $\lambda$ into $xI-A$, then rref and find non-pivot vectors

### Geometric Multiplicity
- $dim(E_\lambda) = nullity(\lambda I-A)$

## Diagonalization
- Diagonalizable if there exist an invertible matrix $P$ that $P^{-1}AP = D$, where $D$ is a diagonal matrix
- Alternatively, $A = PDP^{-1}$
- Examples
	- $I = PIP^{-1}$
	- $D = IDI^{-1}$
- **Eigenvectors** are the columns of $P$ that can be used to diagonalize $A$
- Criteria for diagonalization
	- Eigenvalue MUST ALL BE REAL
	- Algebraic multiplicity equal to geometric multiplicities
		- $1 \leq dim(E_\lambda) = r_\lambda$


## Orthogonal Diagonalization
$A = PDP^T = PDP^{-1}$
- Diagonalization but $P^{-1} = P^T$
- $P$ is an orthogonal matrix
- Properties
	- Eigenspaces are orthogonal to each other

## Powers of Diagonalizable Matrices
$$
\begin{align}
&A^m = PD^mP^{-1}\\
&D^m = D \text{ with each entry }d^m
\end{align}
