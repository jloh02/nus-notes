## Types of Matrix
### Identity Matrix
- 1s on diagonal, 0s everywhere else
- Denoted by $I$
- $I_nA = AI_n = 0$
### Diagonal Matrix
- Similar to identity matrix
- Any number of diagonal, 0s everywhere else
### Zero Matrix
- All zero
- Considered diagonal matrix

## Matrix Multiplication 

$$
C = AB = A\begin{pmatrix}|&|&...&|\\b_1&b_2&...&b_p\\|&|&...&|\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}|&|&...&|\\Ab_1&Ab_2&...&Ab_p\\|&|&...&|\end{pmatrix}
$$

For only getting at $(AB)_{ij}$
- $i^{th}$ row of $A$ $\cdot$  $j^{th}$ row of $B$

If $AB=AC$, we <ins>CANNOT</ins> conclude $B = C$

## Powers of Matrix

For a $n$x$n$ (**square**) matrix:
$A^k = A A A ... A$ (k times)
$A_0 = I$ (identity matrix)

## Transposition
$A^T$
$(A+B)^T = A^T + B^T$
$(AB)^T = B^TA^T$ (**IMPORANT** must swap $BA$)

## Inverse
$n$ x $n$ matrix is invertible only if there is a $n$ by $n$ matrix $C$ such that: $AC = I_n$ and $CA = I_n$
> $det A \neq 0$

$C$ is called the inverse matrix of $A$

- $AA^{-1} = I$, $A^{-1}A = I$
- $(A^{-1})^{-1} = A$
- $(AB)^{-1} = B^{-1}A^{-1}$ (Note swap order)
- $(A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T$

### Characteristics of Invertible Matrices
| Observation | Conclusion |
|---|---|
|The equation $Ax = 0$ has only the trivial solution | Pivot in every column of $A$ |
|The equation $Ax = b$ has a solution for $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$ | Pivot in every row of $A$ |
| Columns of A span $\mathbb{R}^m$ | Can always solve; Pivot in every row of A |
| Columns are linearly independent | Pivot in every column of A |
| Matrix transformation x => Ax is one to one | Pivot in every column of A |
| Matrix transformation x => Ax is onto (By choosing any column vector x, you get all column vectors) | Pivot in every row of A |
| $n$x$n$ matrix is invertible/row equivalent to $I$ | Pivot in every row and column |


If $n$ x $n$ matrix, there is a pivot in every column $\iff$ there is a pivot in every row
### Solution to Matrix
1. If $A$ is invertible $n$ x $n$ matrix ($\text{det }\neq0$)
2. For the equation $Ax=b$, there is a unique solution $x = A^{-1}b$
3. RREF Solve for $(A|I)$, $A$ will become $I$ and $I$ becomes $A^{-1}$

## LU Matrix Factorization
- Assume A is an m x n matrix than can be RREF <ins>without row interchanges</ins>

- Results in a matrix A = LU
- L is a $m$x$m$ lower triangular matrix with 1s on diagonal
- U is a upper triangular $m$x$n$ **echelon form of A**

$$
A = \begin{pmatrix}
1&0&0&0\\
*&1&0&0\\
*&*&1&0\\
*&*&*&1\\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
*&*&*&*&*\\
0&*&*&*&*\\
0&0&0&*&*\\
0&0&0&0&0
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### How to Use LU Factorization
- Ax = LUx = b
- Solve for Ly = b, where y = Ux
- Solve for Ux = y

### How to Decompose A into LU
- Reduce n by m matrix A to echelon form U <ins>without scaling and row interchange</ins> 
- Let $A = E_pE_{p-1}...E_1A = U$
- $A = (E_pE_{p-1}...E_1)^{-1}U$
- $L = (E_pE_{p-1}...E_1)^{-1} = E_1^{-1}E_2^{-1}E_3^{-1}...$
