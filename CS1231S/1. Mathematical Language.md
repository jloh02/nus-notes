## Number Sets
| Set | Definition | 
|---|---|
|$\mathbb {N}$|All natural numbers `{0,1,2,3,...}`|
|$\mathbb {Z}$| All Integers |
|$\mathbb {Q}$| All Rational Numbers | 
|$\mathbb {R}$| All Real Numbers |
| $\mathbb {C}$ | Complex Numbers |
|$\mathbb {Z}^+$| Positive Integers |
|$\mathbb {Z}^-$| Negative Real Numbers |
|$\mathbb {Z}_{\geq12}$| Integers >= 12 |

Note: 0 is neither negative nor positive

## Statements
|Statement|Meaning| Example |
|---|---|---|
|Universal|Dictates a cretain property is true for ALL elements in the set | $\forall$ |
|Conditional | If one is true, another is true | $\rightarrow$ |
| Existential | At least one thing for which it is true (There exists) | $\exists$ |

## Definitions

### Proof Related

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|Proof|A **precise and unambiguous** description of the meaning of a mathematical term. It characterizes the meaning of a word by giving all the properties and **only those properties that must be true**.|
| Theorem | A mathematical statement that is proved using rigorous mathematical reasoning. A theorem is usually a major or important result. |
| Lemma | A small theorem; a minor result whose purpose is to help in proving a theorem. (Occasionally, lemmas can take on a life of their own, eg: Bézout’s lemma.) |
| Corollary | A result that is a simple deduction from a theorem. |
| Conjecture | A statement believed to be true, but for which there is no proof (yet) |

### Numbers

| Term | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Even Integer | $n = 2k, where\ k\ is\ an\ integer$  |
| Odd Integer | $n = 2k+1, where\ k\ is\ an\ integer$  |
| Divisibility | $d \mid n \iff \exists k\in \mathbb{Z} \text{ such that } n=dk$ |
| Transitivity of Divisibility | For all integers a, b, and c, if $a\mid b \text{ and } b\mid c$, $a\mid c$ |
| Rational | $\exists$ $a$, $b \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $r = \frac{a}{b}$ and $b \neq 0$. 
| Fraction in Lowest Term | A fraction (nonzero denominator) $\frac{a}{b}$ (where $b \ne 0$) is in lowest terms if largest integer that divides $a$ and $b$ is 1 |
| Colourful (ONLY FOR CS1231S) | $n$ is colorful if there is an integer $k$ where $n = 3k$ |
## Propositions
For all integers $n$, if $n^2$ is even then $n$ is even
## Properties of Integers
For $x,y,z \in \mathbb{Z}$

| Rule | Example |
|---|---|
|Closure|$x+y \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $xy\in\mathbb{Z}$|
| Commutativity | $x + y = y + x$ | 
| Associativity | $xyz = (xy)z = x(yz)$ |
| Distributivity | $x(y+z) = zy + xz$ |
| Trichotomy | Only one is true: $x = y$, $x > y$ or $x<y$ |

## Abbreviations
| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| iif | If and only if ($\iff$) |
| such that | s.t. |
| WLOG | Without loss of generality; When you narrow a case e.g. WLOG, assume $a < b$ |
| $a \mid b$  | a is a factor of b |
| $a \nmid b$ | a is not a factor of b |
