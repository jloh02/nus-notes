## Relations on Sets
### Relation
Given 2 sets A and B, A (binary) relation from A to B is a subset of A x B (Cartesian Product).
$$
\begin{align}
x\ R\ y \text{ means } (x,y) \in R \\
x\ \not R\ y \text{ means } (x,y) \not\in R
\end{align}
$$
### Domain
Domain of R, $Dom(R)$ is the set $\{a \in A:\ a\ R\ b \text{ for some }b\in B\}$
### Co-Domain
Co-domain of R, $coDom(R)$ is the set $B$
### Range
Range of R, $Range(R)$ is the set $\{b \in B:\ a\ R\ b \text{ for some }a\in A\}$
### Inverse Relations
Relation from B to A
$$
\begin{align}
&R^{-1} = \{(y,x) \in B \times A : (x,y) \in R\}\\
&\text{or}\\
&\forall x \in A, \forall y \in B ((y,x) \in B \times A : (x,y) \in R)
\end{align}
$$
### Directed Graphs
- Relation from set A to A
- Becomes a <ins>directed graph</ins>
- E.g. $xRy \iff 2 \mid (x-y)$

### Composition of Relations
- Let $R \subseteq A \times B$ and $S \subseteq B \times C$
- Composition of R with S denoted by $S\circ R$
- $\forall x\in A, \forall z \in C (xS\circ R z \iff (\exists y\in B (xRy \land ySz)))$
#### Properties of Compositions
- Associative: $T\circ (S\circ R) = (T\circ S) \circ R$
- Inverse: $(S\circ R)^{-1} = R^{-1}\circ S^{-1}$
### N-ary Relations and Relational Databases
- Relation involving 2 sets is binary relation, 3 sets ternary, 4 sets quaternary
- Used in relations in database to link multiple tables

## Reflexivity, Symmetry and Transitivity
### Properties of General Relations
> NOT about specific elements, but about the whole relation
- Reflexive: $\forall x \in A (xRx)$
	- In graph: There exists an edge points a vertex to itself
- Symmetric: $\forall x,y \in A (xRy \implies yRx)$
	- In graph: There exists an edge that makes a specific edge bidirectional
- Transitive: $\forall x,y,z \in A (xRy \land yRz \implies xRz)$
	- In graph: There exists a transitive edge that can join AC instead of AB + BC
### Transitive Closure
The minimal set of relations that connects all vertices directly

Must satisfy the following given relation $R$ and set $A$, and the **transitive closure** of $R$ is $R^t$
- $R^t$ is transitive
- $R \subseteq R^t$
- If $S$ is any relation that contains $R$, $R^t \subseteq S$
	- Minimal - Do not add additional edges in graph
### Relation Induced by Partition
- Partition of Set A (Elements in A are "grouped" into smaller sets)
- Each element of partition are called components

## Equivalence Relations
- $R$ is an equivalence relation iff R is reflexive, symmetric and transitive
- Equivalence Relation: ~
- Same statements
	- $x\sim y$
	- $[x] = [y]$
	- $[x] \cap [y] \neq 0$
### Equivalence Class
- The elements related to a particular element of a equivalence relation
- $[a]_\sim = \{x \in A: a\sim x\}$
### Congruence
- For $a,b \in \mathbb{Z},\ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, a is congruent to b modulo n iff $a -b = nk$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$
- $n \mid (a-b)$
#### Dividing a Set by an Equivalence Relation
- Set of all equivalence classes $A/\sim\ = \{[x]_\sim : x\in A\}$
- The same-component relation wrt a partition is an equivalence relation
- If ~ is a equivalence relation on set A, A/~ is a partition of A

## Partial Order Relations
> R is a partial order iff R is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive
> Symbol for partial order relation: $x \preccurlyeq y$, x is curly less than equal y

### Antisymmetric
> Graphically means all edges are single-directional edges

R is antisymmetric iff $\forall x,y \in A(x\ R\ y \land y\ R\ x \implies x = y)$

### Hasse Diagrams & Partial Order
In a partial order graph 
- There is a loop at every vertex
- All arrows point in the same direction (upward)
To obtain Hasse
- Remove loops
- Transitive arrows
- Direction indicators of arrows
### Comparability
Elements of a and b of A are comparable iff $a \preccurlyeq b$ or $b \preccurlyeq a$
### Maximal/Minimal/Largest/Smallest
#### Maximal
"Roots of Hasse tree"
$\forall x \in A (c \preccurlyeq x \implies c = x)$
#### Minimal
"Leaves of Hasse tree"
$\forall x \in A (x \preccurlyeq c \implies c = x)$
#### Largest
"Single root of Hasse tree"
$\forall x \in A (x \preccurlyeq c)$
#### Smallest
"Single leaf of Hasse tree"
$\forall x \in A (c \preccurlyeq x)$

### Linearization
Ensure when placed in a line, arrow should always point upwards


### Total Order Relations
> aka linear order

R is a total order iff R is a partial order and $\forall x,y \in A (xRy \lor yRx)$
Symbol: $\preccurlyeq^*$
Linearization of partial order is such that $\forall x,y \in A (x\preccurlyeq y \implies y\preccurlyeq^* x)$
#### Well Ordered Set
Let $\preccurlyeq$ be a total order on a set A. A is well-ordered iff every non-empty subset of A contains a smallest element.
$\forall S \in \mathcal{P}(A), S \neq \emptyset \implies (\exists x \in S\ \forall y \in S (x \preccurlyeq y))$


### Congruence
- For $a,b \in \mathbb{Z},\ n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$, a is congruent to b modulo n iff $a -b = nk$ for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}$
- $n \mid (a-b)$
#### Dividing a Set by an Equivalence Relation
- Set of all equivalence classes $A/\sim\ = \{[x]_\sim : x\in A\}$
- The same-component relation wrt a partition is an equivalence relation
- If ~ is a equivalence relation on set A, A/~ is a partition of A

## Partial Order Relations
- **Antisymmetric**: $\forall x,\ y \in A\ (xRy \land yRx\ \Rightarrow\ x=y)$ 
- **Partial Order Relation**: A relation $R$ on set $A$ is a partial order relation iif $R$ is reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. 
- **Partial Order Set**: A partially ordered set $A$ with respect to a partial order relation $R$ on $A$ is denoted by $(A,R)$
- **Comparability**: Elements $a$ and $b$ of $A$ are comparable $\Rightarrow$ $a\preccurlyeq b \lor b\preccurlyeq a$
- **Compatibility**: There is a $c \in A$ such that $a \preccurlyeq c$ and $b \preccurlyeq c$
- **Maximal** ("Roots"): $\forall x \in A\ (c \preccurlyeq x \Rightarrow c=x)$. $c=18$ is a maximal element in the Hasse diagram below. 
- **Minimal** ("Leaves"): $\forall x \in A\ (x \preccurlyeq c \Rightarrow c=x)$. $c=1$ is a minimal element in the Hasse diagram below
- **Greatest/Largest/Maximum**  (Single maximal): $\forall x \in A (x\preccurlyeq c)$
- **Least/Smallest/Minimum** (Single minimal): $\forall x \in A (c\preccurlyeq x)$
- **Well-Ordered Set**: A set is well-ordered iff every non-empty subset of A contains a smallest element. 
$$
\forall S \in \mathcal{P}(A),\ S\neq\emptyset \Rightarrow(\exists x\in S\ \ \forall y\in S\ (x\preccurlyeq y))
$$
### Hasse Diagram
Let $\preccurlyeq$ be a partial order on set $A$. A Hasse Diagram of $\preccurlyeq$ satisfies the following for all distinct $xy,m\in A$: 
	If $x\preccurlyeq y$ and no $m\in A$ is such that $x\preccurlyeq m \preccurlyeq y$, then $x$ is placed below $y$ with a line joining them, else no line joins $x$ and $y$

### Linearization
**Total Order**: In total order, every pair of elements in the set is directly comparable.
$$
\forall x, y \in A\ (xRy\ \lor\ yRx)
$$
**Partial Order**: Not all pairs are directly comparable, there may be elements which are unrelated by order. 
$$
\exists\ x, y \in A\ (x\not Ry\ \land\ y\not Rx)
$$
Linearization of partial order: Let $\preccurlyeq$ be a partial order on set $A$. A linearization of $\preccurlyeq$ is a total order $\preccurlyeq^*$ on $A$ such that $\forall x, y\in A\ (x\preccurlyeq y \Rightarrow x\preccurlyeq^* y)$

- Linearization of total order is a total order
- Linearization of a partial order can be seen as deriving one total order among many possible total orders
#### Khan's Algorithm
Produces a linearization $\preccurlyeq^*$ of $\preccurlyeq$. Pseudo-code as follows: 
```python 
S = A # S and A are sets
Order result = [] # resultant linearization
while S != {}:
	m = minimal(S) # minimal in context of partial order relations
	result.append(m) # add to the linearization
	S = S.remove(m)
return result
```


## Well Defined
To prove if $\mathbb{Q}/\sim$ is well defined where $x\sim y \iff x+y\in \mathbb{Z}$,
$\forall [x_1],[y_1],[x_2],[y_2]\in \mathbb{Q}/\sim (([x_1] = [x_2]) \land ([y_1] = [y_2]) \implies [x_1] + [y_1] = [x_2] + [y_2])$
