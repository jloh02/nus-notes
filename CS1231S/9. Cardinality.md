## Pigeonhole Principle
> Theorem 7.2.3
	If $f : X\rightarrow Y$ is a bijection, then $f^{-1}:Y\rightarrow X$ is also a bijection
	A function is bijective iff it has an inverse

> Pigeonhole Principle
> Let A and B be finite sets. If there is an injection $f : A \rightarrow B$, then $|A| \leq |B|$

> Dual Pigeonhole Principle
> Let A and B be finite sets. If there is a surjection $f : A \rightarrow B$, then $|A| \geq |B|$

## Cardinality
Cardinality of finite set S:
- 0 if empty set
- n if $f:S\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}_n$ is a bijection

> Theorem: Equality of Cardinality of Finite Sets
> Let A and B be any finite sets.
> $|A| = |B|$ iff there is a bijection $f : A \rightarrow B$

Cantor's definition of Cardinality:
Cardinality are equal if there is a bijection $A \rightarrow B$

The same-cardinality is a equivalence relation:
- Reflexive
- Symmetric
- Transitive

## Countably Infinity
- Same cardinality as $\mathbb{Z}^+$ is called countably infinite (also $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$)
- Aleph zero $\aleph_0 = |\mathbb{Z}^+|$

> Theorem (Cartesian Product)
> If sets A and B are countably infinite, $A \times B$ is countably infinite

> Theorem (Unions)
> The union of countably many countable sets is countable

## Larger Infinities

> Theorem 7.4.2 (Cantor)
> The set of real numbers between 0 and 1 is uncountable
> $\{x \in \mathbb{R} | 0 < x < 1 \}$

> Theorem 7.4.3
> Any subset of any countable set is countable

> Theorem 7.4.4
> Any subset of an uncountable set is uncountable

> Proposition 9.3
> Every infinite set has a countably infinite subset

> Lemma 9.4
> Let A and B be countably infinite sets, $A \cup B$ is countable
