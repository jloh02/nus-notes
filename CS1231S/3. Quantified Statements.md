Note: When doing negation, change $\forall$ to $\exists$
Universal Generalization: Choosing an arbitrary $x$ in the given domain, $P(x)$ is always true
$\exists!$ means "there exists a unique"
## Definitions
- A <ins>predicate</ins> is a sentence that contains a finite number of variables and becomes a statement when specific values are substituted for the variables. 
- The <ins>domain</ins> of a predicate variable is the set of all values that may be substituted in place of the variable
- If P(x) is a predicate and x has domain D, the <ins>truth set</ins> is the set of all elements of D that make P(x) true when they are substituted for x. The truth set of P(x) is denoted ${x \in D | P(x)}$.


## Universal Statement
Let Q(x) be a predicate and D the domain of x. A universal statement is a statement of the form “$\forall x \in D, Q(x)$”. 
- It is defined to be true iff Q(x) is true for every x in D.
- It is defined to be false iff Q(x) is false for at least one x in D.
- A value for x for which Q(x) is false is called a counterexample.

### Negation
$$
\sim (\forall x \in D, P(x)) \equiv \exists x \in D \text{ such that } \sim P(x)
$$

## Existential Statement
- Existential Statement: Let Q(x) be a predicate and D the domain of x. An existential statement is a statement of the form “$\exists x\in D \text{ such that } Q(x)$”.
	- It is defined to be true iff Q(x) is true for at least one x in D.
	- It is defined to be false iff Q(x) is false for all x in D.
	- ! is the uniqueness quantifier symbol. It means “there exists a unique” or “there is one and only one”
### Negation
$$
\sim (\exists x \in D, P(x)) \equiv \forall x \in D, \sim P(x)
$$


## Conditions
### Sufficient Condition
$\forall x, r(x)$ is a sufficient condition for $s(x)$ means that $\forall x(r(x) \rightarrow s(x))$
### Necessary Condition
$\forall x, r(x)$ is a sufficient condition for $s(x)$ means that $\forall x(\sim r(x) \rightarrow \sim s(x))$ or $\forall x(s(x) \rightarrow r(x))$
### Only If
$\forall x, r(x)$ only if $s(x)$ means that $\forall x(\sim s(x) \rightarrow \sim r(x))$ or $\forall x(r(x) \rightarrow s(x))$
