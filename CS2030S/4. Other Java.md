## Exceptions
### Try-Catch
```java
try {
    // Code that might cause an exception
    int result = 10 / 0; // This will cause an ArithmeticException
} catch (ArithmeticException e) {
    // Code to handle ArithmeticException
    System.out.println("An arithmetic exception occurred: " + e.getMessage());
} finally {
    // Executed regardless of whether an exception occurred or not
    System.out.println("Finally block executed.");
}
```

### Checked Exceptions
- Checked at compile time
- Need to use `throws` or `try-catch`
```java
public class MyCheckedException extends Exception {
    // Constructors and additional methods can be added if needed
}
```
### Unchecked Exceptions
- Not checked at compile-time
- Used for unexpected situation or programming errors
- Examples
	- Division by zero
	- Running out of memory
```java
public class MyUncheckedException extends RuntimeException {
    // Constructors and additional methods can be added if needed
}
```

## Wrapper Classes
- e.g. `Integer` for `int`
- Autoboxing and unboxing happens when a primitive value is assigned to a wrapper class object or vice versa
	- Also during method invocation and comparison operators
### Autoboxing
```java
int primitiveInt = 42;
Integer wrappedInt = primitiveInt; // Autoboxing
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


### Unboxing
```java
Integer wrappedInt = 42;
int primitiveInt = wrappedInt; // Unboxing
```

## Invariance, Covariance, Contravariance

### Invariance
Does not allow any variation in the type parameter. It means that you cannot use a more derived type or a less derived type where the base type is expected

### Covariance
Allows a more derived (more specific) type to be used where a less derived (less specific) type is expected

```java
List<? extends Fruit> covariantList = new ArrayList<Apple>();
```

### Contravariance
Allows a more general (base) type to be used in a context where a more specific (derived) type is expected

```java
Consumer<? super Apple> contravariantConsumer = new Consumer<Fruit>();
```
